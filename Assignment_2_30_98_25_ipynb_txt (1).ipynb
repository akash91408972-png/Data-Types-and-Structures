What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","  - Main Differences Between Lists and Tuples in Python\n","\n","    #Mutability\n","\n","    List: Mutable; elements can be added, removed, or changed after creation.\n","\n","    Tuple: Immutable; once created, elements cannot be modified.\n","\n","    #Syntax\n","\n","    List: Defined with square brackets [ ].\n","\n","    Tuple: Defined with parentheses ( ).\n","\n","    #Performance\n","\n","    List: Slower in operations due to mutability.\n","\n","    Tuple: Faster in iteration and access because of immutability.\n","\n","    #Use Cases\n","\n","    List: Suitable when data may change (e.g., dynamic collections).\n","\n","    Tuple: Suitable for fixed data (e.g., coordinates, configuration).\n","\n","    #Memory Consumption\n","\n","    List: Consumes slightly more memory.\n","\n","    Tuple: More memory efficient.\n","\n","    #Methods Available\n","\n","    List: Has many built-in methods (append, extend, remove, pop, etc.).\n","\n","    Tuple: Has very few methods (mainly count() and index()).\n","    \n","    EXAMPLE:\n","    \n","    #List example\n","    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","    my_list[0] = 10  # Allowed\n","\n","    #Tuple example\n","    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n","    #my_tuple[0] = 10  # Error: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n","\n","\n","\n","  4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n","  -  Dictionaries store data in the form of key-value pairs. Each key must be   unique and immutable (like strings, numbers, or tuples), while values can be of any data type and can be changed. Data is retrieved by referencing the key, not by position. This makes dictionaries efficient for quick lookups, updates, and deletions.\n","\n","  5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","  - I will use a set instead of a list when I need to store only unique elements and avoid duplicates. A set is faster than a list for checking if an element exists or not. It also allows me to do mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference easily. Unlike lists, sets do not care about the order of elements, so they are good when order is not important but uniqueness and quick search are needed.\n","\n","  6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","  -  A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (single, double, or triple).\n","    Strings are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation, while lists are mutable and allow modification of elements.\n","\n","  7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","  - Tuples ensure data integrity in Python by being immutable, meaning once a   tuple is created its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This immutability prevents accidental modifications and keeps the stored data constant.\n","  \n","  8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","  - A hash table is a way of storing data using a key and a value. The key is   converted into a number by a hash function, and that number decides where the value will be kept in memory. In Python, dictionaries work like hash tables because they also store data as key-value pairs.\n","\n","    EXAMPLE:\n","    \n","    student = {\"name\": \"Arun\", \"age\": 21, \"grade\": \"A\"}\n","\n","    print(student[\"name\"])  # Arun\n","    \n","    print(student[\"age\"])   # 21\n","\n","   9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","   - Yes, lists in Python can contain different data types, such as integers,  strings, floats, booleans, or even other lists.\n","\n","      EXAMPLE:\n","\n","      my_list = [10, \"Hello\", 3.14, True, [1, 2, 3]]\n","\n","      print(my_list) #\n","   10.  Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n","    - Strings are immutable in Python because once a string is created, its characters cannot be changed. This design ensures data safety, makes strings hashable (so they can be used as dictionary keys or set elements), and improves performance by allowing Python to reuse string objects instead of creating new ones each time. If you try to modify a string, Python actually creates a new string object instead of changing the original.#\n","   \n","   11.  What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","   - Dictionaries offer faster lookups, insertions, and deletions because they use keys instead of indexes. They make data easier to access when you know the key, not the position. Dictionaries also allow storing more meaningful relationships between data (key-value pairs), unlike lists which only store values by order.\n","\n","   12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","   - A tuple is preferable when the data should not change after creation. For example, storing the coordinates of a point (x, y) or a person’s date of birth is better in a tuple because these values must stay fixed and should not be accidentally modified.\n","\n","     EXAMPLE:\n","\n","     #Coordinates of a point (should not change)\n","     \n","     point = (10, 20)\n","\n","     #Date of birth (fixed information)\n","     \n","     dob = (15, \"August\", 2000)\n","\n","     \n","     print(\"Point:\", point)\n","    \n","     print(\"Date of Birth:\", dob)#\n","     \n","\n","     \n","     \n","     \n"],"metadata":{"id":"1fSrb4thmne9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["  13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","    \n","       - Sets in Python automatically remove duplicate values. When duplicate elements are added, only one copy is kept in the set.\n","\n","         EXAMPLE:\n","\n","         numbers = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5}\n","         \n","         print(numbers)\n","\n","   14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","    \n","         - For lists, the in keyword checks if a value exists as an element in the list.\n","         \n","            For dictionaries, the in keyword checks if a key exists, not the value .\n","\n","        EXAMPLE:\n","\n","        #List\n","        \n","        fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","        \n","        print(\"apple\" in fruits)     # True\n","\n","       #Dictionary\n","       \n","       student = {\"name\": \"Arun\", \"age\": 21}\n","       \n","       print(\"name\" in student)     # True\n","       \n","       print(\"Arun\" in student)     # False (checks keys, not values)\n","\n","\n","  15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n","\n","  - No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable in Python. Once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This immutability helps protect data from accidental modification and ensures consistency when the data must stay fixed.\n","\n","  16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","\n","  - A nested dictionary is a dictionary inside another dictionary, where values themselves can be dictionaries. It is useful for storing structured or hierarchical data.\n","\n","    EXAMPLE:\n","\n","    students = {\"101\": {\"name\": \"Arun\", \"age\": 21, \"grade\": \"A\"},\n","    \"102\": {\"name\": \"Meera\", \"age\": 22, \"grade\": \"B\"}}\n","\n","    print(students[\"101\"][\"name\"])   # Arun\n","    \n","    print(students[\"102\"][\"grade\"])  # B\n","\n","  \n","  17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n","  - Accessing elements in a dictionary has average time complexity O(1)because it uses hashing to find keys quickly.\n","  In the worst case, due to hash collisions, the time complexity can go up to O(n), but this is very rare in practice.\n","\n","    EXAMPLE:\n","\n","    student = {\"name\": \"Arun\", \"age\": 21, \"grade\": \"A\"}\n","\n","    #Accessing elements\n","    \n","    print(student[\"name\"])   # O(1)\n","    \n","    print(student[\"grade\"])  # O(1)\n","\n","\n","  18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","   - Lists are preferred over dictionaries when the order of elements matters, when we only need to store simple collections of items without key-value pairs, and when accessing elements by their position (index) is enough. They are also better when we need to store duplicate values or perform operations like sorting and slicing.\n","\n"," 19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","\n"," - Dictionaries are considered unordered because they store data based on hash values of keys, not in a fixed sequence like lists. This means the order of insertion is not guaranteed to define how items are stored internally (though from Python 3.7+, insertion order is preserved, but it’s still not the main feature).\n","\n","   This affects data retrieval because you cannot access items by their position (index) like in lists. Instead, you must use the key to get the value.\n","\n","  20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","\n","  - In a list, data is retrieved using an index number that represents the position of the element.\n","In a dictionary, data is retrieved using a key, which directly maps to its value.\n","  \n","    EXAMPLE:\n","\n","    #List\n","    \n","    fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","    \n","    print(fruits[1])   # banana (retrieved by index)\n","\n","\n","    #Dictionary\n","    \n","    student = {\"name\": \"Arun\", \"age\": 21}\n","\n","    print(student[\"name\"])   # Arun (retrieved by key)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qVKr4xlv-6GJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"xEQt5KbfO_o4"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"zWGQG3ax2pyd","outputId":"618c40fb-fbba-46ce-e045-f9dc31b67b1a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["My name is: Akash Srivastav\n"]}],"source":["# 1.Write a code to create a string with your name and print it.\n","\n","# Creating a string with my name\n","name = \"Akash Srivastav\"\n","\n","# Printing the string\n","print(\"My name is:\", name)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#2.Write a code to find the length of the string \"Hello World\".\n","string = \"Hello World\"\n","length = len(string)\n","print(\"Length of the string is:\", length)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ETbJg8Z834f8","outputId":"efa1998f-f412-4772-8e38-ec38b45328a1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Length of the string is: 11\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#3.
